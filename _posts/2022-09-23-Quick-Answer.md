## Summary
This post contains some short answers of the technology questions I met in my daily work, including some other LINK for further details answers.

1. Avoid single point failure
2. Scalability
3. Performance
4. Data security when running backup
5. Analytics

#### How replication synchronize data from master?
Basically, all the events ran in master db, will re-run in replication db as well to achieve synchronization. Every time a event happened in master db, will be written to bin-log. Then the replication read the bin-log and run the events.

#### Replication format?
Bin-log have two different formats, could choose one of them or mix of them. 
1. Statement-based
2. Row-based
